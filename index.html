	<p>Although I love all animals (cats and dogs), I must say that having a dog has alot of benefits that cats do not.

	One of them is that they force you to exercise, since they require that you take them out for a walk because they are very dependent on humans, motivating us to have some company to go outside.</p>

	<p>Another issue is that dogs produce less allergies than cats, I say this from my own experience (sadly, I am allergic to cats). Some scientific studies have proved it, because the cat's saliva has a highly allergic particle for humans, where when they take a bath with their tongue, they leave this protein in the fur and it is what causes serious allergies, like mine.</p>

		<p>First one is that it's virtually impossible for dogs to have an indoors-only lifestyle; they need a lot of exercise, plenty of walks, and time spent outdoors to live happy and healthy lives. But if you don't have a yard or access to parks, or have limited mobility, this may present a major challenge.

		Not only are cats much safer indoors, but they're perfectly happy perched next to a window or curled up in a sunny spot on the couch. Simply crack a window for some fresh air (but make sure it's not open wide enough for kitty to escape), and your cat will be totally content watching birds and bugs all day long.</p>

	<hr width="90%">
	<p>Cats are natural-born hunters, so it's in their DNA to stalk, hunt, and pounce on their preyâ€”even if it's on a television screen. While you should never, ever let your cat eat a bug or mouse it catches, a pest-free home is just one of the many benefits of owning kitties. What's more, your cat's scent alone can keep rodents away from your house; if rodents detect a hunter in the home, they're far less likely to enter.</p>
