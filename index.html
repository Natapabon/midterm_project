	<p>Although I love all animals (cats and dogs), I must say that having a dog has alot of benefits that cats do not.

	One of them is that they force you to exercise, since they require that you take them out for a walk because they are very dependent on humans, motivating us to have some company to go outside.</p>

	<p>Another issue is that dogs produce less allergies than cats, I say this from my own experience (sadly, I am allergic to cats). Some scientific studies have proved it, because the cat's saliva has a highly allergic particle for humans, where when they take a bath with their tongue, they leave this protein in the fur and it is what causes serious allergies, like mine.</p>
